Proper gene annotation of a newly sequenced genome requires masking of repetitive elements (transposons), then automated gene prediction, followed by manual curation. Tools for gene prediction include `augustus`, `MAKER2`, and `BRAKER1`. 

### Masking repeats with `repeatmasker`

This step is important to label transposable elements that might mess up the annotation, and additionally can provide information about the nature and distribution of different types of transposons. In the following line, the analysis was done for a fungal species. `RepeatMasker -h` provides a list of all functions. 
```
RepeatMasker -species Fungi -small -nolow -gff -dir PATH-for-RepeatMasker-directory/ PATH/genome.fa
```
`-nolow` prevents masking of low complexity and simple repeats, and is optional. `-gff` generates an additional GFF output file, which is important for the manual annotation. `-small` returns masked sequence in lower case (standard is N, other options are available). The output will be a masked.fa fasta file meeting the settings, plus the GFF file, a .out file giving localization and statistics of each repeat, and a .tab file summarizing the results of the masking. 


### Gene prediction with `augustus`

   - **training `augustus` with gene models**

*text*

   - ***ab initio* gene prediction**

Using the training database created above, `augustus` can be used to predict gene models *ab initio*. 
```
augustus --species=ref_species new_genome.fa --extrinsicCfgFile=extrinsic.ref_species.cfg > augustus.abinitio.gff
```
This might take a moment to compute. The output is a .gff file containing information about putative gene models. The protein sequences can be extracted with 
```
PATH/augustus/augustus-3.2.3/scripts/getAnnoFasta.pl augustus.abinitio.gff
```
producing a file `augustus.abinitio.aa` in fasta format. To extract gene and CDS sequences, I used `gff2fasta.pl` from https://github.com/ISUgenomics/common_scripts/blob/master/gff2fasta.pl (save script with an edictor like nano).
```
perl PATH/gff2fasta.pl new_genome.fa augustus.abinitio.gff output.prefix
```

   - **including RNA-Seq for prediction**

This requires a BAM and a WIG file(s) produced by mapping of your RNA-Seq against the new genome with a mapper like `STAR` or `HISAT2`. First, RNA-Seq hints have to be produced. There are many options specified in the manual that should be considered for optimization.
```
cat PATH/rnaseq.wig | perl PATH/augustus/augustus-3.2.1/scripts/wig2hints.pl --width=10 --margin=10 --minthresh=2 --minscore=4 --src=W --type=ep --radius=4.5 > rnaseq.track.gff
```
Then, we can predict gene models:
```
augustus --species=ref_species new_genome.fa --extrinsicCfgFile=extrinsic.ref_species.cfg --hintsfile=hints.rnaseq.ep.gff > augustus.hints.abinitio.gff
```
The gene models can be extracted from the .gff as above. 


### Gene prediction with `BRAKER1`

   - ***ab initio* gene prediction**

`BRAKER` requires both a reference gene set and RNA-Seq data, and you need to refer to `Genemark`, `bamtools` and `samtools` binaries:
```
perl PATH/BRAKER/BRAKER_v1.9/braker.pl --cores=8 --fungus --GENEMARK_PATH=PATH/bin/gm_et_linux_64/gmes_petap --BAMTOOLS_PATH=PATH/bamtools/pezmaster31-bamtools-6708a21/bin --SAMTOOLS_PATH=PATH/samtools/samtools-1.3.2 --overwrite --useexisting --species=ref_species --genome=PATH/new_genome.fa --bam=PATH/sortedByCoord.out.bam
```
